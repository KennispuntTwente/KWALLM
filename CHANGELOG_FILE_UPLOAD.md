# File Upload Improvements Changelog

## Issue
**Bug: file upload not working in rare cases**  
- In rare cases, file upload through the web interface does not work
- User selects file & nothing appears to happen in the interface
- Happens with specific Excel files that may contain illegal characters or encoding issues

## Root Cause Analysis
The original file upload implementation had several limitations:
1. **Limited error handling**: Basic tryCatch with generic error messages
2. **No user feedback**: No loading indicators during file processing
3. **Silent failures**: Some edge cases didn't trigger error handlers
4. **Poor error messages**: Generic messages that didn't help users
5. **No file validation**: Files weren't validated before processing

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive File Validation
- Pre-validate files before processing (existence, size, format)
- Check Excel file signatures to detect corrupted files
- Validate file size and warn users about large files (>50MB)
- Detect empty files and provide appropriate feedback

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Encoding fallback for text files (UTF-8, latin1, windows-1252, UTF-8-BOM)
- Better Excel file error detection (corruption, access issues)
- Column selection validation with helpful error messages

### 3. Improved User Experience
- Loading notifications during file processing
- Success notifications with file details (row count, column count)
- Progress feedback for all file operations
- Clear, actionable error messages with guidance

### 4. Robust Error Messages
Added 30+ new translation strings for both Dutch and English:
- "Bestand wordt geladen:" / "Loading file:"
- "Excel-bestand is beschadigd" / "Excel file is corrupted"
- "Kan bestand niet openen" / "Cannot open file"
- "Tekstcodering wordt niet ondersteund" / "Text encoding not supported"

### 5. Comprehensive Testing
Created test files covering edge cases:
- `normal_working.xlsx` - Baseline working file
- `corrupted.xlsx` - Corrupted file for error handling
- `empty.xlsx` - Empty file validation
- `special_chars.xlsx` - Unicode and special characters
- `large_file.xlsx` - 10,000 rows for size warnings
- `mixed_types.xlsx` - Multiple data types
- `special_sheet_names.xlsx` - Sheets with emoji and spaces
- `whitespace_only.xlsx` - Files with only whitespace

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **R/text_upload.R**: Enhanced file upload logic with comprehensive error handling
2. **language/language.json**: Added 30+ new translation strings
3. **tests/testthat/test-file-upload-improvements.R**: New test suite for file upload

### Key Code Improvements:

#### Before:
```r
tryCatch({
  sheets <- readxl::excel_sheets(file_path)
  sheet_names(sheets)
}, error = function(e) {
  showNotification(
    paste("Error bij lezen van Excel-bestand:", e$message),
    type = "error"
  )
})
```

#### After:
```r
# Show loading notification
notification_id <- showNotification("Loading file...", duration = NULL)

# Validate file first
validation_result <- validate_file(file_path, file_ext)
if (!validation_result$valid) {
  showNotification(validation_result$message, type = "error", duration = 10)
  return()
}

# Enhanced error handling with specific messages
tryCatch({
  sheets <- readxl::excel_sheets(file_path)
  removeNotification(notification_id)
  showNotification(paste("Excel file loaded with", length(sheets), "worksheets"), 
                   type = "success")
}, error = function(e) {
  removeNotification(notification_id)
  error_msg <- if (grepl("zip file.*corrupt", e$message)) {
    "Excel file is corrupted or has invalid format"
  } else if (grepl("cannot open", e$message)) {
    "Cannot open Excel file. Check if file is not in use."
  } else {
    paste("Error reading Excel file:", e$message)
  }
  showNotification(error_msg, type = "error", duration = 10)
})
```

## Benefits

### User Experience
- Users always receive feedback, never left wondering what happened
- Clear guidance on how to fix issues
- Progress indicators for all file operations

### Error Prevention
- Files validated before processing prevents application crashes
- Early detection of problematic files
- Better handling of edge cases

### Maintainability
- Clear error handling makes debugging easier
- Comprehensive logging of file operations
- Standardized error message patterns

### Robustness
- Handles encoding issues gracefully
- Detects and handles corrupted files
- Supports large files with appropriate warnings

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Created test files covering all edge cases
2. **Integration Tests**: Shinytest2 tests for full upload workflow
3. **Manual Testing**: Interactive testing with problematic files
4. **Error Scenarios**: Deliberately test failure modes

## Deployment Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- No database migrations required
- New translation strings automatically available in both languages
- Test files included for ongoing validation

**Issue Resolution**: This implementation addresses the core issue where users experienced silent failures during file upload. Now all file upload attempts provide clear feedback to users, and problematic files are handled gracefully with helpful error messages.
